We have an existing report, but we need it to be rewritten to match the style of a report that was created two weeks ago by an analyst. The goal is to maintain the content and data of the current report but adapt it to the stylistic nuances of the previous one.

    First, please review the older report to understand its writing style. Pay close attention to the structure, tone, and the specific way information is presented in it.

    Previous Report Style Reference:
    {text}

    Now, here is the report that needs to be rewritten:

    Current Report:
    
    {{report}}

    Your task is to rework this current report, ensuring that its content and data remain intact, but its style closely resembles that of the previous report. This includes matching the level of detail, tone, and the overall approach to presenting information. 

    We value your assistance in maintaining a consistent and professional style in our reporting, adapting new information to established presentation standards."""
